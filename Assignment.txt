select last but one option in dropdown?

WebElement value1 = driver.findElement(By.id("dropdown3"));
		Select selectValue1 = new Select(value1);
		List<WebElement> allOptions = selectValue1.getOptions();
		int num = allOptions.size();
		selectValue1.selectByIndex(num-1);

Assignment 6:
==============
 		String str3 = new String("Kutty");
		 String str4 = new String("Kutty");
		 
		 if(str3==str4) {
			 System.out.println(" Same text");
		 }
		 else
			 System.out.println("Diff text");
		 
		 System.out.println("***");
ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† Justify the above output
==================================================
Answer:1. The output is Diff text[else condition works here, if always fails here]
== works with int not with string content.If == is used between strings,it will look for the reference.

2.The strings here are declared using new and this dynamic allocation is stored in heap memory.Both the strings will have 
different memory location.== operator is false in this case.

3.When the strings are declared as literal,like Str3 = "kutty" and Str4 = "Kutty".the object will be created in String constant pool. 
This allows JVM to optimize the initialization of String literal.The JVM wont create a new reference,it points to the value.
In that case,== operator is true.

when you have to compare strings, 
you need to use str3.equals(str4) or str3.equalsignorecase(str4)[when you want to compare irrespective of upper or lower case]
The output is Diff text[else condition works here if always fails here]
